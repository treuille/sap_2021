# Simple Data Science Streamlit App
This is a simple data science app that takes a data set about Data Scientists
and runs a pandas profiling package on them. This is for demonstration purposes
to show how easy it is to create and share an app to Streamlit Sharing.

## Directories

- **pandas_page.py:** has the code to use the pandas profiling Streamlit component
  to generate an in depth profile of each feature in our data
